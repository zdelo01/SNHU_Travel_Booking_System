# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 
  I can interpret user needs by listening to the customers and engaging with them as much as possible to create user stories of maximum value to the user. Creating user stories helps with implementing their requests into software because if done correctly they represent the customer’s requested functionality and expected value out of the program. 
 
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I would approach developing programs by first understanding the requirements, then I would determine whether the waterfall model or agile methodology is better suited for the program’s development. I hope to incorporate Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Backlog Refinement, and Sprint Retrospective. “These events are important because they provide transparency and inspection throughout the project allowing teams to understand what they must always work on and adapt when necessary (DeLong, 2022).” “Another benefit of these events is that the team will build on their skills and become more accustomed to the collaborative aspect of agile development (DeLong, 2022).”  
  
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member in software development will have a self-management and cross-functional skillset. They will also be building on their experience, confidence, teamwork, respect, and skillsets.
